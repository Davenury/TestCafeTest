# TestCafeTest

Repository for test of [this library](https://testcafe.io/), so I can spread my wings in E2E testing.
To start every test, simply run `start.sh` script.
If you want to develop new tests, either write them in `index.js` file in one of directories, or create new directory with file `index.js` in it 
(as `start.sh` script will start only `index.js` files).
